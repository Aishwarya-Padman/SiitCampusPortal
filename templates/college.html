               The increasing demands of society & self-employment opportunities, besides many other factors, 
               were responsible for the founder of Shriram Shikshan Sanstha to start a humble beginning in the area 
               of education in Engineering & Technology. The efforts were recognized last year in 2008-09 by granting 
               permission to Shriram Shikshan Sanstha to conduct different three-year Degree Courses.</p>

        <p>In year 2008-09, Sanstha management decided to start courses BSc(E.C.S.) and BCA. 
           The college is located in a rural area, and there were no institutions providing these courses. 
           The management body realized the importance of IT education. There is a huge scope for IT developers 
           and IT technicians in IT industries. But no college provides these courses. 
           For rural area students, this is a big opportunity to learn this type of course. 
           Students from rural areas are not so familiar with computers and IT fields.So after starting these course we are very glad to inform there is large response of students for these courses.

           After very good achievements and best outcomes of these courses Shriram Shikshan Sanstha decided to start post graduation course, MSc(Computer Science) in our institution. MSc(Computer Science) course is started from academic year 2009-10 in our institution. And surprisingly there is good response for this course also.
           
           Our vision to attain global standing in technical and technological course and contribute the enhancement and empowerment of society and country. Our main objective is to focus on rural youth, their training and their career development in information technology field.</p>
